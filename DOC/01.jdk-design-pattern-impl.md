## JDK中设计模式的实现

**Creational patterns**

1. Abstract factory 

> recognizeable by creational methods returning the factory itself which in turn can be used to create another abstract/interface type

 [`javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory#newInstance()`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/xml/parsers/DocumentBuilderFactory.html#newInstance%28%29)

 [`javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory#newInstance()`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/xml/transform/TransformerFactory.html#newInstance%28%29)

 [`javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory#newInstance()`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/xml/xpath/XPathFactory.html#newInstance%28%29)

2. Builder

> recognizeable by creational methods returning the instance itself

`java.lang.StringBuilder#append()` (unsynchronized)

`java.lang.StringBuffer#append()` (synchronized)

`java.nio.ByteBuffer#put()` (also on `CharBuffer`, `ShortBuffer`, `IntBuffer`, `LongBuffer`,` FloatBuffer` and `DoubleBuffer`)

`javax.swing.GroupLayout.Group#addComponent()`

All implementations of `java.lang.Appendable`

3. Factory method

> recognizeable by creational methods returning an implementation of an abstract/interface type

`java.util.Calendar#getInstance()`

`java.util.ResourceBundle#getBundle()`

`java.text.NumberFormat#getInstance()`

`java.nio.charset.Charset#forName()`

`java.net.URLStreamHandlerFactory#createURLStreamHandler(String)` (Returns singleton object per protocol)

4. Prototype 

> recognizeable by creational methods returning a different instance of itself with the same properties

`java.lang.Object#clone() `(the class has to implement `java.lang.Cloneable`)

5. Singleton 

> recognizeable by creational methods returning the same instance (usually of itself) everytime

`java.lang.Runtime#getRuntime()`

`java.awt.Desktop#getDesktop()`

**Structural patterns**

1. Adapter

> recognizeable by creational methods taking an instance of different abstract/interface type and returning an implementation of own/another abstract/interface type which decorates/overrides the given instance

`java.util.Arrays#asList()`

`java.io.InputStreamReader(InputStream)` (returns a Reader)

`java.io.OutputStreamWriter(OutputStream)` (returns a Writer)

`javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.XmlAdapter#marshal()` and `#unmarshal()`

2. Bridge

> recognizeable by creational methods taking an instance of different abstract/interface type and returning an implementation of own abstract/interface type which delegates/uses the given instance

None comes to mind yet. A fictive example would be new `LinkedHashMap(LinkedHashSet<K>, List<V>)` which returns an unmodifiable linked map which doesn't clone the items, but uses them. The `java.util.Collections#newSetFromMap()` and singletonXXX() methods however comes close.

3. Composite 

> recognizeable by behavioral methods taking an instance of same abstract/interface type into a tree structure

`java.awt.Container#add(Component)` (practically all over Swing thus)

`javax.faces.component.UIComponent#getChildren()` (practically all over JSF UI thus)

4. Decorator 

> recognizeable by creational methods taking an instance of same abstract/interface type which adds additional behaviour

All subclasses of` java.io.InputStream`, OutputStream, Reader and Writer have a constructor taking an instance of same type.

`java.util.Collections`, the checkedXXX(), synchronizedXXX() and unmodifiableXXX() methods.

`javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequestWrapper` and `HttpServletResponseWrapper`

5. Facade 

> recognizeable by behavioral methods which internally uses instances of different independent abstract/interface types

`javax.faces.context.FacesContext`, it internally uses among others the abstract/interface types LifeCycle, ViewHandler, NavigationHandler and many more without that the enduser has to worry about it (which are however overrideable by injection).

`javax.faces.context.ExternalContext`, which internally uses ServletContext, HttpSession, HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, etc.


6. Flyweight 

> recognizeable by creational methods returning a cached instance, a bit the "multiton" idea

`java.lang.Integer#valueOf(int)` (also on Boolean, Byte, Character, Short and Long)

7. Proxy

> recognizeable by creational methods which returns an implementation of given abstract/interface type which in turn delegates/uses a different implementation of given abstract/interface type

`java.lang.reflect.Proxy`

`java.rmi.*`, the whole API actually.

**Behavioral patterns**

1. Chain of responsibility

> recognizeable by behavioral methods which (indirectly) invokes the same method in another implementation of same abstract/interface type in a queue

`java.util.logging.Logger#log()`

`javax.servlet.Filter#doFilter()`

2. Command

> recognizeable by behavioral methods in an abstract/interface type which invokes a method in an implementation of a different abstract/interface type which has been encapsulated by the command implementation during its creation

All implementations of `java.lang.Runnable`

All implementations of `javax.swing.Action`

3. Interpreter

> recognizeable by behavioral methods returning a structurally different instance/type of the given instance/type; note that parsing/formatting is not part of the pattern, determining the pattern and how to apply it is

`java.util.Pattern`

`java.text.Normalizer`

All subclasses of `java.text.Format`

All subclasses of `javax.el.ELResolver`

4. Iterator 

> recognizeable by behavioral methods sequentially returning instances of a different type from a queue

All implementations of `java.util.Iterator `(thus among others also java.util.Scanner!).

All implementations of `java.util.Enumeration`

5. Mediator

> recognizeable by behavioral methods taking an instance of different abstract/interface type (usually using the command pattern) which delegates/uses the given instance

`java.util.Timer` (all scheduleXXX() methods)

`java.util.concurrent.Executor#execute()`

`java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService` (the invokeXXX() and submit() methods)

`java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService` (all scheduleXXX() methods)

`java.lang.reflect.Method#invoke()`

6. Memento 

> recognizeable by behavioral methods which internally changes the state of the whole instance


`java.util.Date` (the setter methods do that, Date is internally represented by a long value)

All implementations of `java.io.Serializable`

All implementations of `javax.faces.component.StateHolder`

7. Observer (or Publish/Subscribe) 

> recognizeable by behavioral methods which invokes a method on an instance of another abstract/interface type, depending on own state


`java.util.Observer/java.util.Observable` (rarely used in real world though)

All implementations of` java.util.EventListener` (practically all over Swing thus)

`javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionBindingListener`

`javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionAttributeListener`

`javax.faces.event.PhaseListener`

8. State

> recognizeable by behavioral methods which changes its behaviour depending on the instance's state which can be controlled externally

`javax.faces.lifecycle.LifeCycle#execute()` (controlled by FacesServlet, the behaviour is dependent on current phase (state) of JSF lifecycle)

9. Strategy 

> recognizeable by behavioral methods in an abstract/interface type which invokes a method in an implementation of a different abstract/interface type which has been passed-in as method argument into the strategy implementation

`java.util.Comparator#compare()`, executed by among others Collections#sort().

`javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet`, the service() and all doXXX() methods take HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse and the implementor has to process them (and not to get hold of them as instance variables!).

`javax.servlet.Filter#doFilter()`

10. Template method 

> recognizeable by behavioral methods which already have a "default" behaviour definied by an abstract type

All non-abstract methods of `java.io.InputStream`, `java.io.OutputStream`, `java.io.Reader` and `java.io.Writer.`

All non-abstract methods of `java.util.AbstractList`, `java.util.AbstractSet` and `java.util.AbstractMap`.

`javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet`, all the doXXX() methods by default sends a HTTP 405 "Method Not Allowed" error to the response. You're free to implement none or any of them.

11. Visitor

> recognizeable by two different abstract/interface types which has methods definied which takes each the other abstract/interface type; the one actually calls the method of the other and the other executes the desired strategy on it


`javax.lang.model.element.AnnotationValue` and `AnnotationValueVisitor`

`javax.lang.model.element.Element` and `ElementVisitor`

`javax.lang.model.type.TypeMirror` and `TypeVisitor`
