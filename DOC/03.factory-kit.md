# 工厂模式 factory-kit

## 目的

使用分离的构建器和工厂接口定义不可变内容的工厂

## 适合场景

+ a class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create
+ you just want a new instance of a custom builder instead of the global one
+ you explicitly want to define types of objects, that factory can build
+ you want a separated builder and creator interface
